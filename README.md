# M.I.N.D - My Indexed Knowledge Directory

M.I.N.D is a personal AI knowledge assistant built to represent a developer's experience, projects, technical decisions, and professional background.

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine semantic search with a Large Language Model (LLM). Knowledge is stored as Markdown files, indexed using embeddings, stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector, and retrieved dynamically when answering questions.

The Markdown knowledge base remains the Single Source of Truth. PostgreSQL is used as a generated retrieval index that can be discarded and rebuilt whenever the knowledge structure, chunking strategy, metadata schema, or embedding model changes.

The goal is to create an AI assistant that can answer questions about a candidate's:

* Projects
* Technical experience
* Architecture decisions
* STAR stories
* CV and career history
* Engineering opinions and preferences

Retrieved evidence is manually evaluated to determine whether it is sufficient to support claims made in generated answers.

# Knowledge Base Structure

Each project is represented by a Markdown document containing YAML frontmatter and structured project documentation.

The frontmatter contains information such as:

* Title
* Organization
* Role
* Environment
* Period
* Status
* Technologies
* Concepts
* Links

The Markdown content contains sections such as:

* Overview
* Context
* Task
* Challenges
* Results
* Technical Decisions
* Implementation
* Lessons Learned
* Future Improvements

The Markdown files are version controlled and remain the authoritative source.

# How It Works

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with three distinct stages.

## 1. Knowledge Indexing

1. Project knowledge is maintained as Markdown documents with YAML frontmatter.
2. The KnowledgeIndexer discovers and parses the documents.
3. The content is split into semantic sections and enriched with project metadata.
4. A 384-dimensional embedding is generated for each document chunk.
5. The chunks, metadata, and embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL using pgvector.

## 2. Semantic Retrieval

1. A user question is converted into an embedding using the same embedding model.
2. pgvector performs semantic similarity search.
3. The most relevant project sections and their metadata are retrieved as evidence.

## 3. Answer Generation

1. The retrieved evidence is supplied to the LLM.
2. The configured provider/model fallback chain attempts the request until a provider succeeds or all configured options fail.
3. The LLM generates a candidate-oriented response based on the retrieved evidence.

# How to Run

## 1. Start infrastructure

Start PostgreSQL with pgvector:

    docker compose up -d

---

## 2. Install Ollama and embedding model

Install Ollama and make sure the embedding model is available:

    ollama pull bge-small-en-v1.5

The project uses `bge-small-en-v1.5` for both document and query embeddings.

The model generates 384-dimensional vectors.

---

## 3. Build knowledge index

Import the Markdown knowledge base and generate the retrieval index:

    dotnet run --project src/tools/KnowledgeIndexer

The indexer will:

1. Discover Markdown files recursively.
2. Exclude template documents.
3. Parse YAML frontmatter.
4. Extract project metadata.
5. Split documents into semantic sections.
6. Clean generated section content.
7. Ignore empty sections.
8. Propagate project metadata to each chunk.
9. Generate embeddings.
10. Store chunks, metadata, and vectors in PostgreSQL.
11. Output the generated index structure for manual inspection.

The generated PostgreSQL index can be rebuilt from the Markdown knowledge base.

---

## 4. Start backend API

Run the ASP.NET Core API:

    dotnet run --project src/backend/Api

---

## 5. Use API with Swagger

The API can be tested manually using Swagger UI:

    http://localhost:5179/swagger/index.html

Endpoint:

    POST /api/v1/Questions

Example request:

    {
      "question": "What experience do I have with PostgreSQL and pgvector?"
    }

The API workflow is:

1. Receive the question.
2. Generate an embedding for the question.
3. Search relevant knowledge using pgvector.
4. Retrieve the highest-ranked project sections.
5. Build the LLM prompt based on a set of instructions, the question and the retrieved evidence
6. Send the prompt to the configured LLM.
7. Use the configured fallback chain if the selected provider/model fails.
8. Return the generated answer, together with evidence chunks and similarity scores

---

# Semantic Retrieval

The retrieval system uses the same embedding model for both indexed documents and user queries, ensuring they occupy the same embedding space.

The query flow is:

1. A user question is converted into an embedding.
2. pgvector performs semantic similarity search against the indexed document embeddings.
3. The top-ranked project sections and their metadata are retrieved.
4. The retrieved context is supplied to the LLM.

Each retrieved result contains:

- Similarity score
- Source document
- Project
- Section
- Retrieved content
- Project metadata

The current test workflow exposes the top 10 results for manual inspection.

Similarity scores are used to compare retrieval results, but they are not treated as probabilities or as a universal relevance threshold.

---

# Metadata-Aware Retrieval

Project metadata is stored in YAML frontmatter and propagated to every generated chunk.

This provides a foundation for future metadata-aware retrieval.

Metadata can be used for:

* Technology filtering
* Role filtering
* Organization filtering
* Environment filtering
* Project status filtering
* Project-level ranking
* Retrieval explanations
* Candidate-to-job matching

The system intentionally does not rely exclusively on semantic interpretation of the project documentation.

For example, evidence that PostgreSQL was mentioned in a project does not automatically prove that it was used in production.

---

# LLM Integration

The backend uses a provider-independent `ILLMClient` abstraction.

Provider-specific clients are responsible for:

* HTTP requests
* Authentication
* Request formatting
* Response parsing
* Provider-specific error handling

The current clients include:

* `GoogleClient`
* `GroqClient`
* `OpenRouterClient`
* `CerebrasClient` as an optional client for future use

`LlmClientFactory` creates provider/model clients based on configuration.

`FallbackLlmClient` controls the execution order and fallback behavior.

---
# LLM Configuration

LLM configuration is represented through:

* `LlmOptions`
* `LlmProviderOptions`

The provider and model configuration is defined in `/appsettings.json`.

Shared configuration includes:

* Maximum output tokens
* Thinking level
* Reasoning effort

Each configured provider defines:

* Provider name
* Ordered model list
* Request timeout

The active provider configuration includes:

* OpenRouter
* Google
* Groq

Cerebras is configured as a supported client but is not currently included in the active provider list.

API keys are supplied through environment variables rather than stored in source-controlled configuration.

The provider and model configuration is structured as:

* `Llm`
  * `Providers[]`
    * `Name`
    * `Models[]`
    * `TimeoutSeconds`

Providers are evaluated in the order defined in `Providers[]`.

Models are evaluated in the order defined in each provider's `Models[]` collection.

This allows providers and models to be added, removed, or reordered through configuration without changing the provider implementations.

---

# LLM Fallback

The fallback layer evaluates the provider/model combinations defined in `/appsettings.json` sequentially.

The fallback order is determined entirely by the configured order:

1. Providers are evaluated in the order they appear in `Llm.Providers[]`.
2. Models are evaluated in the order they appear in each provider's `Models[]`.
3. A failed provider/model combination causes the fallback layer to continue with the next configured combination.
4. The first successful request ends the fallback process.

For example, the current configuration is evaluated in this general order:

1. OpenRouter / configured model 1
2. OpenRouter / configured model 2
3. Additional OpenRouter models
4. Google / configured model
5. Groq / configured model

The fallback layer logs each provider/model attempt.

Example:

    [LLM] Trying: Google / gemini-3.6-flash

If a request fails:

    [LLM] Failed: Google / gemini-3.6-flash (...) Status=400 Transient=False

If a later provider succeeds:

    [LLM] Provider succeeded: Groq / openai/gpt-oss-120b (...)

The fallback implementation provides:

* Sequential model fallback within a provider
* Sequential provider fallback
* Provider/model failure logging
* HTTP status and transient failure information

---

# Evidence-Based Answer Generation

The system treats retrieval quality and answer quality as separate problems.

Semantic similarity alone does not guarantee that the retrieved evidence is sufficient to support an answer.

The LLM instructions are designed to:

* Use retrieved context as evidence
* Avoid inventing technologies
* Avoid inventing responsibilities
* Avoid inventing project experience
* Avoid inferring production experience without explicit evidence
* Distinguish technology usage from production usage
* State clearly when the available evidence is insufficient

For example:

    Technology used
            !=
    Technology used in production

The system therefore attempts to prevent technically plausible but unsupported candidate claims.

---

# Technical Decisions

## Markdown as the Source of Truth

Project knowledge is maintained as Markdown files in the repository.

This provides:

* Human-readable documentation
* Git-based version control
* Easy editing
* Easy review
* Simple rebuilding of the retrieval index

PostgreSQL is treated as generated retrieval infrastructure.

If the indexing strategy changes, the database representation can be discarded and rebuilt from the Markdown source.

---

## YAML Frontmatter

YAML frontmatter is used for structured project metadata.

Important information does not have to be inferred from natural-language content.

The metadata is parsed during ingestion and propagated to every generated chunk.

This provides a foundation for metadata-aware retrieval and candidate-to-job matching.

---

## Section-Based Chunking

Documents are initially split using Markdown headings.

Each Markdown section becomes an independent retrieval unit while preserving its position within the source document.

Sections such as:

* Overview
* Context
* Task
* Challenge
* Result
* Technical Decisions
* Lessons Learned
* Future Improvements

become retrieval units.

Nested headings are preserved as section paths. For example:

* `Overview`
* `Lessons Learned > Lesson: Infrastructure Is Part of the Application`
* `Action > Technical Decisions > Decision: PostgreSQL with Docker Compose > Context`

Each generated chunk retains:

* Source document
* Project metadata
* Section heading
* Semantic type
* Section content

This metadata is preserved through indexing and retrieval and is exposed in the API response together with the retrieved content and relevance scores.

Section-based chunking provides more meaningful retrieval boundaries than arbitrary character-based splitting while preserving the structure of the original knowledge document.

Very large sections are currently a known limitation and may require secondary splitting in a future iteration.

---

## PostgreSQL with pgvector

PostgreSQL is used as the retrieval index for the generated knowledge chunks.

The current knowledge base does not justify introducing a separate vector database.

Each stored chunk contains:

* Chunk content
* Source document
* Section and heading
* Project metadata
* Embedding vector

pgvector provides vector similarity search over the stored embeddings.

Keeping the vector and structured project metadata in PostgreSQL allows retrieval results to include both the matched content and the metadata required for candidate-oriented ranking and inspection.

The index is rebuildable from the Markdown knowledge base, making PostgreSQL a generated retrieval layer rather than the source of truth.

---

## Local Embeddings

The development environment generates embeddings locally through Ollama using BAAI `bge-small-en-v1.5`.

The embedding model produces 384-dimensional vectors.

Advantages include:

* No embedding API cost during development
* Local processing without sending knowledge content to an external embedding service
* Reproducible development and testing
* Full control over the embedding pipeline

The same model is used for both document and query embeddings.

Changing the embedding model requires the knowledge base to be re-indexed because the existing vectors are tied to the model and embedding dimensions.

---

## Provider-Independent LLM Architecture

The LLM layer is separated from the application through `ILLMClient`.

This prevents application-level code from becoming tightly coupled to a specific LLM provider.

Provider-specific request handling remains inside concrete clients, while application-level code works against the common interface.

The trade-off is additional abstraction and configuration complexity.

---

## Model and Provider Fallback

Providers contain ordered model lists.

Each provider/model combination is evaluated independently according to the order defined in `appsettings.json`.

This provides resilience against:

* Invalid API keys
* Unavailable models
* Rate limits
* Quota limitations
* Provider failures
* Temporary service failures

The trade-off is increased latency when several fallback candidates fail sequentially.

The fallback order should therefore be based on availability, latency, model quality, cost, rate limits, and reliability rather than simply adding every available model.

---

# Testing and Evaluation

The retrieval system is currently evaluated primarily through manual test runs.

The evaluation has covered questions involving:

* ASP.NET Core experience
* Azure authentication
* CI/CD experience
* PostgreSQL
* pgvector
* PostgreSQL with .NET
* Database experience
* ERP systems
* Production experience
* Personal and school projects
* Broader backend and API development
* Docker
* Azure
* Terraform
* React and TypeScript
* GDPR and form-builder development
* API and system integrations
* Job-oriented project matching

The test questions are also used to investigate retrieval and ranking behavior, including:

* Broad technology questions
* Specific implementation details
* Production versus non-production experience
* Multiple projects matching the same technology
* Potential false-positive retrievals
* Job-description-oriented retrieval across multiple requirements

The retrieval output is inspected together with:

* Combined relevance score
* Vector similarity score
* Metadata score
* Evidence score
* Source project
* Section heading
* Semantic type
* Retrieved content
* Project metadata

The current test workflow exposes the top 10 retrieved results for manual inspection.

Metadata-aware scoring and evidence-aware reranking are already implemented and exposed as part of the retrieval evaluation output.

The evaluation is currently manual and does not yet contain a formal automated retrieval benchmark.

---

# LLM Provider Testing

The provider fallback implementation has been tested with provider failures.

Testing has included:

* Invalid API keys
* Unavailable models
* Provider failures
* Successful fallback execution

Invalid Google and Groq credentials were skipped successfully when later fallback candidates were available.

OpenRouter testing also exposed an issue with free model identifiers.

A model can remain configured while no longer being available through a particular endpoint or free tier.

Provider/model availability therefore needs to be treated as a runtime concern rather than assuming that a configured model identifier will always remain valid.

---

## User Interface and Productization

The current submission is intentionally backend-focused. A future version could extend the API into a publicly accessible candidate assistant with:

* React-based chat interface
* Candidate-oriented user experience
* Job-description input and analysis
* Candidate-to-job matching
* Source references in generated answers
* Authentication and access control
* Production deployment and monitoring

These features are outside the scope of the current Module 4 submission.

---

# Status

The backend project is complete for the scope of the Module 4 submission.

The following components are operational:

* Markdown knowledge ingestion
* YAML frontmatter and project metadata extraction
* Semantic section-based chunking
* Local embedding generation through Ollama
* PostgreSQL and pgvector retrieval
* Metadata-aware retrieval and reranking
* Manual retrieval evaluation and inspection
* Evidence-based LLM answer generation
* Configurable multi-provider LLM fallback
* REST API for question answering and retrieval results

The API can answer questions using retrieved project evidence and exposes the retrieved sources and relevance information alongside the generated answer.

The current implementation is intentionally focused on the backend ingestion, retrieval, evaluation, and LLM integration required for the project scope.

A future iteration could extend the system into a publicly accessible candidate assistant with a React-based user interface and additional production infrastructure.
