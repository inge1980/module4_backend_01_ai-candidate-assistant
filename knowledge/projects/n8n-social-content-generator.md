# Overview

This project is an n8n-based automated social media content-production pipeline for a family planning and family organization themed social media channel.

The workflow generates structured social media content with Google Gemini, retrieves relevant stock-image candidates from Pexels, uses Gemini to select an appropriate candidate, processes the selected image into a finished social asset, stores the generated asset in Google Drive, and persists the resulting content and metadata in Google Sheets.

Google Sheets serves as both lightweight persistence and the human-facing content-management interface. The workflow supports scheduled and manual execution and keeps content creation and posting states separate so generated material can remain subject to human review.

The project is a development-stage automation prototype. It produces content and image assets but does not implement automated social media publishing.

---

# Context

The project originated as a hobby experiment with n8n and cloud productivity tools.

The objective was to automate repetitive social media content production without building a dedicated content-management application, while retaining a simple human review mechanism for generated content.

The intended content domain covers family planning and organization topics including parenting, household organization, time management, digital parenting, chores, kid responsibility, allowance and money literacy, family technology, meal planning, seasonal planning, family teamwork, and relatable family situations.

The content was intended to provide useful family-oriented advice while indirectly building awareness and perceived value around an upcoming family planner application.

The workflow needed to generate both written content and an associated visual asset. It also needed to reduce repeated subjects and avoid reusing previously selected stock images where possible.

The project was intentionally constrained to existing cloud productivity and automation tools rather than a custom frontend, backend, or dedicated database.

---

# Task

The responsibility in this project was to design and implement the automated content-production workflow in n8n.

The work included:

- Designing the n8n workflow architecture.
- Integrating Google Sheets for persistence and human review.
- Retrieving historical content and using previous subjects and image IDs as generation context.
- Generating multiple structured content ideas with Google Gemini.
- Converting generated records into independently processable workflow items.
- Integrating the Pexels search API.
- Providing Pexels candidate metadata to Gemini for semantic image selection.
- Preserving Pexels image and photographer metadata.
- Downloading selected image binaries.
- Processing images and overlaying generated text.
- Encoding processed assets as JPEG.
- Uploading generated assets to Google Drive.
- Combining generated content, image metadata, and generated asset information.
- Persisting completed records in Google Sheets.
- Supporting scheduled and manual workflow execution.

The implementation was an automation pipeline rather than a conventional application. No dedicated frontend, custom REST API, or custom backend service was implemented.

---

# Challenge

## Challenge: Validating LLM Output Before Workflow Processing

### Problem

The workflow depended on Google Gemini to generate multiple content records that would subsequently be consumed by deterministic n8n nodes.

Each generated record required a predictable structure containing:

- A subject.
- An image caption.
- Short content.
- Long content.
- Image-search keywords.

The generated content also had requirements around subject length, content length, evergreen subject matter, image-keyword formatting, topic relevance, and avoiding previously generated subjects.

LLM output is probabilistic. A response can contain unexpected Markdown, malformed JSON, missing fields, additional fields, incorrect data types, or otherwise valid JSON that does not satisfy the application's actual requirements.

The difficult part was therefore not simply asking Gemini for JSON. It was establishing a usable contract between model output and downstream automation.

### Solution

Google Gemini was connected through n8n's LLM integration.

The generation instructions defined the target social media theme, audience, content direction, required fields, formatting expectations, length constraints, image-keyword requirements, and historical subjects that should be avoided.

The model was instructed to produce multiple content objects in a structured array.

The workflow then separated the generated collection into individual n8n items so that each content record could continue independently through the downstream image pipeline.

The implementation relied on parsing the model response before splitting the generated records. This was sufficient for the prototype, but parsing alone was intentionally treated as a reliability boundary rather than a complete validation strategy.

A production version should validate every generated object against an explicit white-list schema before allowing it to proceed. Validation should cover required properties, data types, length constraints, allowed formats, and any business-specific rules.

### Result

A single generation step, with a corresponding prompt sent to an LLM, can produce multiple content records that are processed independently.

The workflow has a defined data contract for normal model responses, while the limitations of model-generated structured data are clearly isolated at the LLM boundary.

The prototype does not provide deterministic validation of every content requirement.

---

## Challenge: Reducing Repeated Content Without a Dedicated Retrieval System

### Problem

Repeated ideas become increasingly likely when an automated system continuously generates content inside a constrained subject domain.

The workflow needed awareness of previously generated subjects and previously selected images.

The existing Google Sheet already contained this historical information, but the project did not justify introducing a dedicated database, vector store, or search infrastructure.

The challenge was to reuse the available history without turning the prototype into a larger retrieval system.

### Solution

Historical records are retrieved from Google Sheets before new content is generated.

The workflow extracts previously used subjects and image IDs and supplies them as exclusion context to subsequent LLM operations.

Historical subjects are used during content generation to discourage repeated topics.

Historical image IDs are supplied during image selection to discourage reuse of previously selected stock images.

This provides a lightweight form of historical context without adding another persistence or retrieval service.

### Result

The workflow can use existing spreadsheet history to reduce obvious repeated subjects and image selections.

The approach is intentionally probabilistic. Gemini can still produce semantically equivalent subjects using different wording, disregard an exclusion instruction, or select an image that has already appeared in the historical set.

The implementation therefore provides duplicate avoidance rather than deterministic duplicate prevention.

---

## Challenge: Separating Image Retrieval From Semantic Image Selection

### Problem

A keyword search is useful for finding candidate stock images but does not reliably determine which candidate best represents the generated content.

A family-oriented query can return several visually plausible images with different contexts, moods, subjects, and compositions.

Selecting the first search result would make the final asset heavily dependent on Pexels ranking rather than the meaning of the generated content.

### Solution

The workflow separates candidate retrieval from candidate selection.

Generated image keywords are sent to the Pexels search API.

The search is constrained to portrait-oriented imagery and returns a limited candidate set.

Candidate metadata is then supplied to the chosen LLM together with the generated content.

The selection context includes information such as:

- Generated short content.
- Pexels image IDs.
- Image descriptions.
- Image URLs.
- Photographer information.
- Previously used image IDs.

The LLM then selects the candidate that best represents the generated content and intended tone.

The selected image ID and associated metadata are then passed into the image-processing pipeline.

The important architectural boundary is:

1. Pexels retrieves candidates.
2. The LLM selects the most contextually appropriate candidate.
3. The workflow validates and processes the selected candidate.
4. The selected source metadata is preserved for persistence.

### Result

The workflow does not simply accept the first search result and does not require the LLM to provide an image URL.

Pexels remains responsible for retrieving real candidates while the LLM provides contextual selection.

The selection is still probabilistic and depends on the quality of the retrieved candidate set and available metadata.

---

## Challenge: Preserving Source Provenance Through Asset Generation

### Problem

The final image is a generated asset derived from a third-party stock image.

If the workflow retained only the processed image, the relationship between the generated asset and its source would be lost.

The system therefore needed to preserve source-image identity and photographer information while the source image passed through binary processing.

### Solution

Source-image metadata is maintained separately from the processed image binary.

The workflow preserves information including:

- Pexels image ID.
- Original Pexels image URL.
- Photographer ID.
- Photographer name.
- Photographer URL.

The final Google Sheets record stores this information alongside the generated Google Drive asset reference.

The generated asset and its source asset therefore remain distinct records within the workflow's persistence model.

### Result

Generated assets retain traceable source provenance.

The spreadsheet provides enough metadata to identify the source image and photographer associated with each generated asset.

This provides an audit trail but does not itself guarantee legal compliance. Actual attribution and usage requirements depend on the applicable Pexels terms and the intended use.

---

## Challenge: Converting Remote Stock Images Into Finished Social Assets

### Problem

The Pexels result is only an input image. The workflow needed to turn that image into a usable social media asset containing generated text.

The processing also had to work with binary image data while keeping the generated content and source metadata available for later persistence.

### Solution

The selected Pexels image is downloaded as binary data through an HTTP request.

The image-processing stage overlays generated content onto the source image.

The generated image text and subject are rendered with a visual offset technique that creates an outline or shadow-like effect without requiring a separate graphics application.

The processed image is encoded as JPEG and given a generated filename.

The resulting asset is uploaded to a configured Google Drive folder.

The Drive reference is stored separately from the original Pexels URL so that the generated asset and its source remain distinguishable.

### Result

The workflow automatically transforms a remote stock image into a finished social media oriented image and stores the resulting asset in Google Drive.

The composition is functional but not fully responsive. Text placement is based on fixed positioning rather than calculating layout from image dimensions, text length, wrapping, and safe areas.

This limits robustness for unusually long subjects or captions.

---

## Challenge: Separating Binary Image Processing from Business Metadata

### Problem

The workflow produces two fundamentally different types of information:

- Binary image data used by image-processing operations.
- Structured business metadata used by the final content record.

Image-processing operations do not naturally preserve every business field required by the spreadsheet.

Passing all business metadata through every binary-processing step would also increase workflow complexity and make the data flow harder to reason about.

### Solution

The workflow maintains image binary processing and structured metadata on separate branches.

The image-processing branch focuses on downloading, transforming, encoding, and storing the generated asset.

The metadata branch retains source-image and generated-content information required by the final record.

The generated asset reference and source metadata are combined at the persistence boundary before the final Google Sheets write.

This creates a clear separation between asset transformation and business-record construction.

### Result

Binary image operations remain isolated from most business metadata handling.

The final persistence step receives the information required to create the complete content record.

The trade-off is that the workflow must explicitly correlate the separate branches before persistence.

---

## Challenge: Human Review with Google Sheets Instead of a CMS

### Problem

The project needed human review without building a custom administration interface.

Generated content could not reasonably be treated as automatically approved simply because the LLM produced it.

At the same time, introducing a dedicated CMS would have contradicted the project's intentionally lightweight scope.

### Solution

Google Sheets is used as the human-facing content interface.

Each generated record contains separate creation and posting status fields.

Creation states include:

- `To Do`
- `Created`
- `Approved`
- `Declined`

Posting states include:

- `To Do`
- `Unlisted`
- `Published`

The spreadsheet allows a human reviewer to inspect generated content, review the associated image, and change lifecycle state.

The workflow therefore treats the spreadsheet as both a persistence layer and a lightweight moderation interface.

### Result

The project provides human review without requiring a custom frontend.

However, while the creation status field is enforced, the posting status field is not currently an enforced state machine as long as this prototype is not connected to a social media account.

---

# Action

## Architecture

### Frontend

Google Sheets acts as the human-facing interface for generated content and lifecycle review.

The spreadsheet exposes generated content, image information, asset references, and creation/posting states to the human reviewer.

This is effectively a lightweight content-management interface rather than a conventional frontend.

### Backend

n8n acts as the workflow orchestration and integration layer.

It coordinates:

- Scheduled execution.
- Manual execution.
- Historical record retrieval.
- Gemini content generation.
- LLM output transformation.
- Pexels candidate retrieval.
- Gemini image selection.
- Image download.
- Image processing.
- Google Drive asset storage.
- Metadata correlation.
- Google Sheets persistence.

There is no custom REST API, application server, or conventional backend service.

The workflow itself provides the application logic and orchestration.

### Database

Google Sheets is used as a lightweight persistence and workflow-state store.

Each row represents a generated content item.

The schema includes:

- `Subject`
- `Creation Status`
- `Posting Status`
- `ImageID`
- `ImageURL`
- `ImageOriginal`
- `ImageOwnerID`
- `ImageOwnerName`
- `ImageOwnerURL`
- `Keywords`
- `ContentImage`
- `ContentShort`
- `ContentLong`

The records serve three related purposes:

1. Persisting generated content.
2. Providing a human-facing review surface.
3. Providing historical context for subsequent generation runs.

Creation and posting are represented as separate dimensions.

The spreadsheet functions as lightweight persistence rather than a strongly consistent application database, with limited transactional guarantees, validation, concurrency control, and schema enforcement.

### File Storage

Google Drive stores the generated JPEG assets.

The workflow uploads processed images to a configured Google Drive folder and stores the resulting reference as `ImageURL`.

The original Pexels source URL is stored separately as `ImageOriginal`.

This maintains a distinction between the generated asset and its source asset.

### Infrastructure

The n8n instance used during development was hosted on Railway.

Railway provides the hosting environment for the automation runtime rather than acting as a custom application backend.

External services used by the workflow include:

- Google Gemini.
- Google Sheets.
- Google Drive.
- Pexels.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Use Google Sheets as Persistence and the Human Interface

#### Context

The project required a simple persistence mechanism and a way for a human to inspect and review generated content.

Building a dedicated database and administration interface would have significantly increased implementation scope for a small automation prototype.

#### Chosen Solution

Google Sheets was used for both persistence and human interaction.

Generated records are written directly to the spreadsheet.

The same records are later read back as historical context for future generation runs.

The schema contains generated content, lifecycle state, image metadata, source provenance, and generated asset references.

#### Alternatives Considered

A dedicated database and custom administration UI were possible alternatives, but they were outside the implemented prototype.

#### Trade-offs

The approach provides:

- Minimal infrastructure.
- Familiar human interaction.
- Simple n8n integration.
- Easy inspection and manual editing.
- Immediate reuse of historical records.

The disadvantages are:

- Weak transactional guarantees.
- Limited concurrency control.
- Human-editable schema.
- Limited validation.
- Increasing coupling between workflow logic and spreadsheet structure.
- Poor scalability as workflow volume and complexity increase.

The decision is appropriate for the prototype's scope but would become increasingly problematic for production-scale processing.

---

### Decision: Use LLM-Based Semantic Image Selection

#### Context

Pexels search provides candidate images but keyword relevance alone does not guarantee contextual relevance.

The workflow needed a mechanism to choose among multiple plausible results based on the meaning of the generated content.

#### Chosen Solution

Pexels retrieves a bounded candidate set.

The LLM receives the generated content and candidate metadata and selects the most contextually appropriate image.

The workflow retains the selected image's original Pexels metadata.

#### Alternatives Considered

Alternative ranking approaches could have been deterministic metadata scoring, embeddings, or a dedicated image-ranking model.

#### Trade-offs

Advantages include:

- Little custom ranking logic.
- Semantic interpretation of generated content.
- Flexible selection based on context and tone.
- Clear separation between retrieval and ranking.

Disadvantages include:

- Probabilistic selection.
- Dependence on Pexels metadata quality.
- Potentially inappropriate but technically valid selections.

---

### Decision: Use Structured LLM Output at Model Boundaries

#### Context

Downstream workflow operations require predictable fields.

Free-form model responses introduce unnecessary ambiguity and make failures harder to detect.

#### Chosen Solution

The image-selection path uses structured output through the n8n LLM integration.

The content-generation path converts the model response into structured records before the records enter the item-processing pipeline.

The workflow treats the model boundary as a contract that must be validated before downstream processing.

#### Trade-offs

Structured output reduces ambiguity and simplifies downstream processing.

However, structural validity does not guarantee semantic or business correctness. A model can produce a syntactically valid record containing invalid values, an inappropriate image ID, or content that violates a business rule.

The workflow therefore still requires deterministic validation after model output.

---

### Decision: Use Historical Spreadsheet Data as Generation Context

#### Context

The workflow needed to reduce repeated subjects and image selections without introducing a dedicated retrieval infrastructure.

The existing spreadsheet already represented the project's historical content library.

#### Chosen Solution

Historical records are read from Google Sheets and reduced to previously used subjects and image IDs.

These values are supplied to the LLM as exclusion context during generation and image selection.

#### Trade-offs

The approach is simple and inexpensive for a small dataset.

Its weaknesses are:

- Semantic duplicates are not guaranteed to be detected.
- Model instructions can be ignored.
- Historical context grows with the dataset.
- Prompt size increases over time.
- Latency and model cost can increase.
- Full-history context becomes inefficient at larger scale.

For a larger content library, deterministic duplicate checks should happen before model-based exclusion, with selective historical retrieval used where semantic comparison is actually needed.

---

### Decision: Keep Human Review in Google Sheets

#### Context

Generated content was intended to remain subject to human review without a dedicated frontend interface.

#### Chosen Solution

Google Sheets stores separate creation and posting status fields.

The human reviewer can inspect generated records and update their lifecycle state directly in the spreadsheet.

#### Trade-offs

The approach is transparent and simple.

The workflow can consume resources before human approval, including:

- Pexels search.
- Image selection.
- Image download.
- Image processing.
- Google Drive storage.

Approval could be moved earlier in the lifecycle, to reduce resource use.

---

### Decision: Separate Creation State From Posting State

#### Context

Content generation and social media publishing are different lifecycle concerns.

A piece of content can be created and approved without necessarily being published.

#### Chosen Solution

The spreadsheet maintains separate creation and posting status fields.

Creation status describes the content-production and review lifecycle.

Posting status describes the separate publishing lifecycle.

#### Trade-offs

Separating the two dimensions prevents publishing state from being conflated with content-review state.

The limitation is that the spreadsheet currently represents posting states without enforcing valid transitions.

A production implementation should define explicit transitions and make workflow execution depend on those transitions.

---

### Decision: Separate Binary Asset Processing From Structured Metadata

#### Context

The workflow needs to transform image binaries while retaining generated content and source-image metadata.

Keeping all data on one branch would unnecessarily couple image processing to business-record construction.

#### Chosen Solution

Binary image processing and structured metadata are maintained on separate branches and correlated before persistence.

The binary branch handles the generated asset.

The metadata branch preserves source and content information.

The final persistence stage combines the two.

#### Trade-offs

Advantages include:

- Clear separation of responsibilities.
- Less metadata passing through binary-processing operations.
- Easier reasoning about asset transformations.
- Reduced risk of losing source metadata during image operations.

The disadvantage is the need for explicit correlation before the final record is written.

---

## Implementation

### Features

- Scheduled social media content generation.
- Manual workflow execution for development and testing.
- Historical-content retrieval.
- Historical subject and image-ID context.
- LLM-assisted duplicate avoidance.
- Multiple content ideas per generation run.
- Structured image-selection output.
- Pexels stock-image retrieval.
- Semantic image selection.
- Photographer attribution.
- Binary image download.
- Automated image captioning.
- JPEG generation.
- Google Drive asset storage.
- Google Sheets persistence.
- Separate creation and posting lifecycle fields.
- Human review through spreadsheet-based status management.

The workflow does not implement automated social media publishing.

### APIs

The workflow integrates with the Pexels REST API through its image search capability.

The generated image keywords are used as the search query.

The search is configured for portrait-oriented imagery and retrieves a limited set of candidate results.

Google Gemini is accessed through n8n's Gemini integration for both content generation and semantic image selection.

Google Sheets and Google Drive are accessed through their corresponding n8n integrations rather than through custom API client code.

### Data and Persistence

Generated records are persisted as spreadsheet rows containing:

- Generated content.
- Lifecycle status.
- Image-search information.
- Selected Pexels image metadata.
- Photographer information.
- Generated asset reference.
- Source-image reference.

Google Drive stores the generated JPEG asset.

Google Sheets stores the metadata required to connect the generated asset with its source image and generated content.

Historical spreadsheet records are read before generation so previous subjects and image IDs can be supplied as model context.

### Automation

The workflow has two execution entry points.

The scheduled trigger starts the workflow according to its configured schedule.

The manual trigger allows the same workflow to be executed during development and testing.

Both entry points feed the same content-generation pipeline.

Historical records are retrieved before new content is generated.

Generated records are then processed independently so one content item can proceed through image retrieval, semantic selection, asset processing, storage, and persistence without requiring the generated content to remain a single combined payload.

### Testing

The workflow includes a manual execution path for development and testing.

The workflow also contains handling for the empty-history case so generation can proceed when no previous spreadsheet records exist.

Validation was primarily performed through manual workflow execution and inspection of generated spreadsheet records and image assets.

---

# Result

The project produced a working development-stage automated content-production pipeline capable of generating social media content, retrieving stock imagery, selecting images semantically, processing image assets, preserving source attribution, storing generated assets in Google Drive, and persisting content and metadata in Google Sheets.

The resulting spreadsheet functions as a lightweight content library and human review interface without requiring a custom CMS or frontend.

The project demonstrates practical integration of LLM generation, API-based candidate retrieval, semantic candidate selection, binary image processing, cloud storage, spreadsheet persistence, historical context, and human-controlled lifecycle state within a single automation workflow.

---

# Lessons Learned

## Lesson: LLM Output Is a Reliability Boundary

The project demonstrated that model instructions are not equivalent to application rules.

Instructions such as "return valid JSON", "avoid previous subjects", or "select the most relevant image" describe desired model behavior but do not guarantee it.

This changed how model integrations should be treated architecturally.

LLM output should be considered untrusted input at the workflow boundary.

Requirements that affect correctness should be enforced deterministically after the model response.

This includes:

- Required fields.
- Data types.
- Length constraints.
- Allowed values.
- Duplicate checks.
- Image-ID validation.
- URL validation.
- Attribution validation.
- Business-state validation.

The LLM should generate or rank candidates. Deterministic workflow logic should enforce constraints.

---

## Lesson: Structured Output Is Not the Same as Valid Business Data

A structured response can still contain incorrect information.

A model can return structurally valid data that still violates business rules, such as selecting an inappropriate image, exceeding content constraints, or repeating existing topics.

This reinforced that structural validation and business-rule validation are separate concerns.

---

## Lesson: Retrieval and Ranking Should Be Separate

Pexels and Gemini naturally have different responsibilities.

Pexels retrieves candidate images.

Gemini interprets the generated content and ranks the candidates semantically.

Keeping these responsibilities separate creates a useful architectural boundary for future deterministic filtering, scoring, or alternative ranking mechanisms.

The separation is important because retrieval and semantic candidate selection have different cost, reliability, and scalability characteristics.

---

## Lesson: Spreadsheet History Is Not Semantic Retrieval

Using historical spreadsheet records as Gemini context works for a small dataset, but it does not constitute semantic retrieval.

The model receives historical exclusions as context rather than retrieving only the most relevant previous records.

As the history grows, prompt size, latency, and model cost can increase while semantic duplicate detection remains probabilistic.

For a larger content library, deterministic normalization and exact duplicate checks should happen first, followed by selective semantic retrieval when semantic similarity actually needs to be evaluated.

---

## Lesson: Preserve Provenance as Part of the Data Model

The generated image and the original Pexels image are different assets.

Retaining the Pexels image ID, source URL, photographer ID, photographer name, photographer URL, and generated Drive reference preserves the relationship between them.

This is useful for:

- Attribution.
- Auditing.
- Debugging.
- Asset management.
- Reprocessing.
- Understanding where generated assets originated.

Provenance should therefore be treated as part of the record rather than incidental metadata.

---

## Lesson: Binary Data and Business Metadata Have Different Lifecycles

The workflow demonstrated that image binaries and business metadata do not need to travel through the same processing path.

The binary branch can focus on downloading, transforming, encoding, and storing the image.

The metadata branch can preserve generated content and source information.

The two can be correlated at the persistence boundary.

This pattern reduces unnecessary coupling in workflows that combine binary processing with structured business data.

---

## Lesson: LLM Calls Are Explicit Cost and Reliability Boundaries

The LLM is used for two different operations:

1. Content generation.
2. Semantic image selection.

Each model call introduces latency, API cost, probabilistic behavior, and validation requirements.

This makes LLM usage an architectural dependency rather than an invisible implementation detail.

Deterministic processing should be preferred whenever it can enforce a requirement more reliably, cheaply, and predictably.

---

## Lesson: External APIs Need Validation at Their Boundaries

The workflow depends on external services for content generation, image retrieval, cloud storage, and persistence.

A successful HTTP response or integration-node execution does not necessarily mean the returned data is suitable for the next processing stage.

External data should therefore be validated before it becomes trusted internal state.

This applies to:

- LLM output.
- Pexels candidate data.
- Image downloads.
- Generated asset references.
- Spreadsheet records.

This is particularly important when one external service's output becomes another service's input.

---

## Lesson: Prototype Architecture Should Not Be Mistaken for Production Architecture

The project demonstrated that n8n, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Gemini, and Pexels can form a practical automation stack without a custom application.

It also exposed where that simplicity becomes a limitation.

Production requirements would introduce stronger needs around:

- Schema validation.
- Idempotency.
- Explicit state transitions.
- Retries.
- Error handling.
- Observability.
- Concurrency control.
- Persistent identifiers.
- Data integrity.
- Access control.

The prototype architecture was not inherently wrong. Its trade-offs were appropriate for a small development project, but those trade-offs would need to be revisited as scale and reliability requirements increase.

---

# Future Improvements

- Replace fragile model-response parsing with native structured output where supported and validate every generated record against an explicit schema.
- Add deterministic validation for required fields, field types, content lengths, keyword formatting, and allowed lifecycle values.
- Add deterministic duplicate detection for normalized subjects and selected image IDs before relying on model-generated exclusions.
- Move human approval before image search, image selection, image download, image processing, and Drive upload if approval is intended to act as a resource-control gate.
- Define explicit lifecycle transitions for draft, validated, approved, processing, ready, declined, publishing, published, and failed states.
- Add dynamic image composition based on image dimensions, text length, line wrapping, margins, and safe areas.
- Introduce semantic retrieval or embeddings if the historical content library becomes large enough that full-history prompting becomes inefficient.
- Move generation parameters such as number of ideas, categories, content-length limits, image orientation, candidate count, model configuration, and schedule into centralized configuration.
- Add publishing integration only after generation, approval, asset generation, validation, retry handling, and recovery are reliable.
- Introduce a stronger persistence layer if spreadsheet scale, concurrency, or data-integrity requirements exceed what Google Sheets can reliably provide.
